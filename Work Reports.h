/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Iterator, some of remove functions

        -Implemented: All other functions except for remove functions in the B+Tree are implemented and most of them working.
        -Partly implemented: Remove

    Bugs     : For remove no bugs found, need to implement various cases fo tree decreases height properly

    Reflections:
        Need to pay attention where I need to update the info such as data type and number of child because small mistakes like these can screw up the program.
